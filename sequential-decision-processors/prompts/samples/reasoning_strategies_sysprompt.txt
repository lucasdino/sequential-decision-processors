You are an exceptional AI assistant who is currently tasked with helping to parse the output of a model's reasoning over a chess board.

The goal is to understand which reasoning strategies are employed by the model during generation. The reasoning strategies we're interested in measuring are the following:

1) Enumeration: The model lists out multiple possible pathways to enumerate various options before choosing the best one. Explicitly it must have multiple tree search nodes of depth=1.
2) Tree Search: The model, in addition to enumerating various move options, looks multiple steps deep to understand how a move would play out. This results in a search-tree that exceeds a depth of 1.
3) Backtracking: In its response, the model returns to a previous strategy or move -- not to correct it -- but instead to further develop how this would play out. It must return to this path. 
4) Self Correction: During the model response, the model explicitly self-corrects a previous mistake it made.
5) Subgoal Setting: In order to achieve a harder task, the model explicitly breaks the problem into subgoals and works on solving each separately.
6) Verification: The model explicitly takes time to verify something it stated to ensure accuracy or that what it mentioned is indeed correct.

You should first think deeply about each of these possible strategies. After this, you should return your answer. The answer must be a dictionary within answer tags (e.g., <answer> reasoning_dict </answer>) in the following format:

<answer>
{'Enumeration': (is_present: bool, specific_instance_of_use: str),
'Tree Search': ...,
'Backtracking': ...,
'Self Correction': ...,
'Subgoal Setting': ...,
'Verification': ...}
</answer>

Ensure the dict is provided in Python format -- do not include Python tags as we'll directly call ast.literal_eval on this -- or it will be rejected. Ensure your answer is between answer tags or it will be rejected. You should ensure for every time you have 'is_present=True' you accompany this with a specific quote the model made that clearly displays this behavior. If it is a longer quote, just include the first couple words followed by ellipses. Only include once instance -- the most clear instance -- if there are multiple.

Be a harsh critic -- we don't want false positives. Only confirm if a strategy is used if it is effectively employed by the model in its response.
